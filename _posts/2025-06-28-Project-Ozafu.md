# What is Ozafu?

I started working on **Ozafu** after struggling with poor blood circulation in my hamstrings during long working hours. While sitting on a good chair kept me comfortable initially, my productivity steadily declined as time went on. The stiffness in my legs—especially in the hamstrings—made it increasingly difficult to stay focused.


Even though I use an ergonomic chair and an adjustable table, they don’t completely solve the issue. That’s why I decided to create a project for myself—**a chair that allows me to sit in dozens of different positions**, with one essential feature: **my legs can always be extended**.

Ozafu is designed for people who enjoy sitting or working on the floor, or who are fans of **Zafu-style seating**, but want more comfort and flexibility.

Just because only a minority of people work while sitting on the floor doesn't mean it's a strange or inconvenient idea. In fact, one of the biggest advantages of floor sitting is the ability to **change positions more frequently**, which is beneficial for posture and long hours of remote work.According to [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/29/health/floor-sitting-benefits-wellness-partner/index.html), regularly shifting your position while sitting on the floor may help with mobility, flexibility, and long-term joint health.

# Developing Ozafu

The very first prototype of Ozafu was simple: I found a second-hand ergonomic chair and removed its legs. I then glued together several parts, smoothed out the sharp edges, and began working on a way to support both **laptop and desktop use**.

The hardest part is creating a stable and adjustable work surface that can adapt to different sitting positions while remaining robust and reliable.
