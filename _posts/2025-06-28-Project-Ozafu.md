# What is Ozafu ? ? ? 

I decided to start working on Ozafu after continously strugling with my hamstrings poor blood circulation that happens after long working hours. Sitting on good chair keeps me comfertable, but my productivity seemed to continiously reduce after longer hours of working because of stiff feeling in my hamstrings. Even though I have an ergonomical chair and adjustable table, they still can completely reduce this. Therefore, I wanted to create a project for myself that would address this issue, by creating a chair where I can sit in dozens of different positions, and most importantly, my legs can always be extended. Ozafu is for those who love sitting or working on floor or like to sit in Zafus. 

Something that is not commonly used doesnt mean that it is straing and unconvenient idea. 


# Developing Ozafu 

The very first prototype of Ozafu is just simply finding a nice ergonomical chair from second hand, and remove the legs from it. Gluing multiple parts together, fining the sharp corners and adding a possibility to work on laptop and desktop if willing to. The last part is the hardest, since it needs to be robust, and positions could be changed.
