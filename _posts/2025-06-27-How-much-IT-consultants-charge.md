## Consultant Pricing and Affordable Alternatives

Many factors affect the hourly rate of a consultant, including their experience, productivity, task complexity, and how long theyâ€™ve been working with a client. In Finland, typical hourly rates for software contractors range from **100â‚¬ to 150â‚¬** ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/18bdv18/how_much_software_contractors_earn_in_finland/)). Rates at this level often exclude small businesses from being able to afford such services.

To address this, some companies such as **BI Book** offer standardized reporting solutions tailored for clients like restaurants. While these solutions reduce costs compared to custom development, they can still feel expensive to small players in the market, especially when compared to hiring a recently graduated developer.
