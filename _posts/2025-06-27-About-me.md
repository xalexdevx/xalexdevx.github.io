## Hello there, visitor from this or another planet ðŸ‘½

I'm **Mark**, a guy in his mid-20s inspired by both artists and tech founders. I live in Finland, but I love to travel, especially to various Asian countries whose cultures continue to fascinate and inspire me.

My core expertise lies in **Business Intelligence**, but I also dedicate a lot of my free time to **photography**, **music production**, **web development**, and building various side projects aimed at making daily life easier.

I recently completed a **Masterâ€™s degree in Finance** and gained valuable work experience at companies like **ABB** and **Varma**. You can read my master's thesis here: [One index, many regions: revenue distribution and index performance : Evidence from the Euro Stoxx 50](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2025051342483)
