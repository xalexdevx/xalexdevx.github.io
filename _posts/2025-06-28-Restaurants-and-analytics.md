## Analytics
After working for several years in both SMEs and large international companies across different industries and teams, I’ve seen how much capital is invested into analytics. The reason is clear: without insightful **Business Intelligence** solutions, decision-makers are more likely to make poor choices that can hinder a company’s growth.

That’s why it is essential for **all companies**, including small restaurants, to adopt data-driven tools. These tools can help answer critical questions such as:

- Which dishes sell best during specific seasons?
- Which menu items could be repriced based on margin performance?
- What are the peak hours or days for sales?
- How do supply costs and waste levels affect profitability?

To help address these challenges, I’m happy to offer my **affordable expertise** in analytics and automation, specifically tailored for small restaurants aiming to improve their productivity and profitability.
