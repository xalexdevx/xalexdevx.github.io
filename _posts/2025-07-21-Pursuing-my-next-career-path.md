## Things at which I want to be extreamely good

-Under development- 




As I am once again facing unemployment as of July 31, 2025, the inner pressure makes me question my future career goals. It’s obviously much easier to focus on what you want to achieve when you have a stable income, but once you’re unemployed, you start questioning where that income will come from next. Thankfully, I have some savings, which give me a few months to really focus deeply on my next career steps.

These are relatively simple things that I want to become great at, and I will dedicate a significant amount of time to pursuing them in the coming months:
- Learn about the FinTech industry by building real products.
- Master MBB-level communication skills.
- Build and deploy products in weeks, not months.
- Document everyday progress through photos and videos.

In simple terms, I want to become quite good at coding, gain a solid understanding of various financial instruments, develop strong storytelling and communication skills, adopt an entrepreneurial mindset that values fast, consistent delivery over perfection, and continue improving my photography as a creative hobby.
